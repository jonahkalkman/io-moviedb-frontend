# io-moviedb-frontend

A frontend assignment for iO Digital in Rotterdam that got me a job offer in their development team.

[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/jonahkalkman/io-moviedb-frontend)

# Environment variables

Create an .env file with the following:

```
VITE_OMDB_API_KEY="APIKEY"
```

# Improvements

- Create Error component for all errors
- Create Input component for all input fields
- Move all text to JSON file
- @ paths instead of ../ paths
